## What's a "Developer Narrative"?

A Developer Narrative is a form of Career Narrative, a story which is, essentially, about you. Think of it as the picture that you'd like to leave anyone interested in your worknot just employers. Documents like résumés or C.V.s only tell part of your story; the Developer Narrative is your chance to provide some of the reasoning behind your choices, interests, and motivations. While you'll likely never show this document to anyone, the writing you do here forms the basis for how you present and talk about yourselfeven so much as to inform design or content choices for your LinkedIn profile or web site.
